# Cocktail-Sort-and-Nearest-Enemies

Given coordinates of the player and enemies, sort the list of enemies from closest to farthest relative to the player's position

the constant PLAYER represents the x and y coordinates of the player
the constant ENEMIES represents an array of the x and y coordinates of each enemy

the function dist calculates the distance between two points
the function closest_enemies takes a point and compares it to a list of points, and returns the list of points from closest to farthest
